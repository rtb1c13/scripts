#  This script adds a chain ID to all the subunits (column 22) in    #
#  the PDB file.                                                     #
#  The chains are named 'A','B','C',etc. until all of the subunits   #
#  have been labeled.                                                #
#                                                                    #
#  For the subunits to be renamed properly the PDB must contain a    #
#  line beginning with TER after each subunit, for example:          #
#  ...                                                               #

#  TER                                                               #
#  ATOM   1571  N   SER   104      16.936   7.767  30.236            #

#  The original file is first read by the script, then copied to a   #
#  backup file - with the same name, but with "~" added at the end   #
#  of it - and then it is renamed and saved with the original name.  #
#                                                                    #

#  rename_pdb.py arg1 arg2                                           #
#  arg1 is the the number of chains that have to be renamed;         #
